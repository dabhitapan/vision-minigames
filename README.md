WrnchAI based minigames using Python Flask and Javascript

## Inspiration
We found the wrnchAI framework really interesting and wanted to make a fun, simple game out of it.

## What it does
Its a pinball game controlled by your elbows and hands. 

## How I built it
We used Python Flask for the web framework and used wrnchAI SDK within the Backend. The pinball game itself was built in Javascript. 

## Challenges I ran into
Using the wrenchAI SDK proved to be a bit challenging at first and the original plan was to connect it to a 3D rendering using Panda3D. Unfortunately, Panda3D proved to be a bit difficult to work with and we decided to go with a javascript based webgame instead.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Finally learning how to get started with deep learning and computer vision based software, interfacing it with javascript and finally having something demo

## What I learned
How to get started with deep learning and computer vision based software, interfacing Python and javascript in Flask and how to do joint calculations.

## What's next for vision-pinball
Hopefully creating more minigames using this platform.
